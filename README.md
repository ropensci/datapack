The *datapack* R package provides an abstraction for collating 
heterogeneous collections of data objects and metadata into a bundle that can 
be transported and loaded into a single composite file.  The methods in 
this package provide a convenient way to load data from common repositories 
such as DataONE into the R environment, and to document, serialize, and save 
data from R to data repositories worldwide.

> Note that this package ('datapack') is not related to the similarly named rOpenSci package 'DataPackageR'.
> Documentation from the DataPackageR github repository states that "DataPackageR is used to reproducibly
> process raw data into packaged, analysis-ready data sets."

## Installation Notes 

The *datapack* R package requires the R package *redland*. If you are installing on Ubuntu then the Redland C libraries
must be installed before the *redland* and *datapack* package can be installed. If you are installing on Mac OS X or Windows then installing these libraries is not required.

The following instructions illustrate how to install *datapack* and its requirements.

### Installing on Mac OS X

On Mac OS X datapack can be installed with the following commands:

```
install.packages("datapack")
library(datapack)
```

The *datapack* R package should be available for use at this point.

Note: if you wish to build the required *redland* package from source before installing *datapack*, please see the redland [installation instructions](https://github.com/ropensci/redland-bindings/tree/master/R/redland).

## Installing on Ubuntu

For Ubuntu, install the required Redland C libraries by entering the following commands 
in a terminal window:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install librdf0 librdf0-dev
```

Then install the R packages from the R console:

```
install.packages("datapack")
library(datapack)
```

The *datapack* R package should be available for use at this point

## Installing on Windows

For windows, the required redland R package is distributed as a binary release, so it is not
necessary to install any additional system libraries.

To install the R packages from the R console:

```
install.packages("datapack")
library(datapack)
```

## Quick Start

See the full manual for documentation, but once installed, the package can be run in R using:

```
library(datapack)
help("datapack")
```

Create a DataPackage and add metadata and data DataObjects to it:

```
library(datapack)
library(uuid)
dp <- new("DataPackage")
mdFile <- system.file("extdata/sample-eml.xml", package="datapack")
mdId <- paste("urn:uuid:", UUIDgenerate(), sep="")
md <- new("DataObject", id=mdId, format="eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.0", file=mdFile)
addData(dp, md)

csvfile <- system.file("extdata/sample-data.csv", package="datapack")
sciId <- paste("urn:uuid:", UUIDgenerate(), sep="")
sciObj <- new("DataObject", id=sciId, format="text/csv", filename=csvfile)
dp <- addData(dp, sciObj)
ids <- getIdentifiers(dp)
```

Add a relationship to the DataPackage that shows that the metadata describes, or "documents", the science data:

```
dp <- insertRelationship(dp, subjectID=mdId, objectIDs=sciId)
relations <- getRelationships(dp)
```  

Create an Resource Description Framework representation of the relationships in the package:

```
serializationId <- paste("resourceMap", UUIDgenerate(), sep="")
filePath <- file.path(sprintf("%s/%s.rdf", tempdir(), serializationId))
status <- serializePackage(dp, filePath, id=serializationId, resolveURI="")
```  
Save the DataPackage to a file, using the BagIt packaging format:

```
bagitFile <- serializeToBagIt(dp) 
```

Note that the *dataone* R package can be used to upload a DataPackage to a DataONE Member Node
using the *uploadDataPackage* method. Please see the documentation for the *dataone* R package,
for example:

```
vignette("upload-data", package="dataone")
```
